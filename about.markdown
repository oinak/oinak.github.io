Hi, I am a software writer from Madrid, Spain.
I work mainly with [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).
You can find my more technical musings at [Dev.to](https://dev.to/oinak).
Most of my public code is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/oinak) however,
my work happens mainly at private repos.
I lead a team of awesome developers at [Returnly](https://returnly.com), there
we work to make post-purchase experiences smooth for a variety of U.S. e-commerce
brands.
